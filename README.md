# Frontend
<p>
This is the frontend for my frontend amazon clone web app located <a href="https://frontendamazonclone.azurewebsites.net/">here</a>
</p>

<p>
This frontend uses React and SCSS and uses app.js to run on azure with node.
</p>

<p>
To run on your own machine:<br/>
npm install<br/>
npm run start:dev<br/>
</p>

<p>
You can then navigate to localhost: 3030 to access the development react page
